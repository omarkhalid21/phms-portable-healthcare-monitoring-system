 this file contains the code sued to configure a wearable device,mobile application and a companion robot

It is a system for caring for people in the period of recent epidemic diseases, especially elderly people. To relieve pressure on hospitals and health care providers to provide better health care. My system is divided into four parts. First is a wearable device; second is an IoT platform; third is a PHMs application; and last is a robot.

A wearable device is responsible for getting patient vital signs and alerts by clicking the emergency button or when they get out of normal range and sending the data to the IoT platform.
The IoT platform is a hybrid of two platforms to get the maximum number of features. So, we use the Thingspeak and Firebase platforms to authenticate with applications and get analytics from Google Analytics and real-time databases. To get the best dashboard, we use Thingspeak to get data with charts and can export the patient history as an Excel sheet. We can give access to anyone with a degree, such as a viewer, editor, or administrator.

The application has two interfaces: the doctor's face and the patient, to make contact between doctor and patient easy, get meeting schedules, make voice calls directly, monitor vital signs, or use the medicine table or management robot from movement or the medicine box and chat with the chatgpt API or get the GPS location of the robot. Users have access to the light menu of the app and can change the language of the app at the end of their support page to get support for us or, in an emergency, call a doctor, family member, or Ambulance.

robot responsible for getting patient medicine on time from many medicine boxes and with many features, such as ambient lighting and sensors for fire and temperature alerts and humidity.

We can take multiple actions in an emergency. Our system can alert in three ways.
First, wearable devices can send alerts via WhatsApp.
Second, robots can send alerts via telegram.
Third, Thingspeak can alert for backups using MATLAB analysis.
